"""List Less Than Ten  
list numbers elements if conditional
Exercise 3 (and Solution)
Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user."""

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

for i in a:
    if i < 5:
        print (i)

print("------------------------")

number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 89 "))

for i in a:
    if i < number:
        print(i)
