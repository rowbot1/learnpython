"""Divisors  
Exercise 4 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)"""


user_number = int(input("Enter a Number: "))

list_range = range(1, user_number + 1)

for element in list_range:
    if user_number % element == 0:
        print(element)
